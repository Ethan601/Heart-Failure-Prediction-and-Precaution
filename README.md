# Heart-Failure-Prediction-and-Precaution
Academic Project
Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are the #1 cause of death globally, accounting for 31% of all deaths worldwide. Four out of 5CVD deaths are due to heart attacks and strokes, and one-third of these deaths occur prematurely in people under 70 years of age. Heart failure is a common event caused by CVDs and this dataset contains 12 variables that can be used to predict a possible heart disease (supervised) or generate precautionary advices for high-risk cohort by exploring latent correlations among features/label (unsupervised).

People with cardiovascular disease or who are at high cardiovascular risk (due to the presence of one or more risk factors such as hypertension, diabetes, hyperlipidaemia or already established disease) need early detection and recommendation wherein a machine learning model can be of great help.

One goal of the project was to find latent relationships among physical features and cluster them so that latent trends towards any heart disease became more evident. The other goal was to predict whether anybody is likely to get heart failure or not based on the input parameters like age, gender and various test results.
